        <h2 class="headline">My life after Erasmus</h2>
        <h6>Monday, Septembre 2nd, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>I came back on <em>June 16th</em>, and started working at C&A on Monday 18th. I was so sad. I felt like Paris was not my home anymore...<br> My friends were still in Madrid and I already missed them so much. Erasmus was the <strong>BEST</strong> experience of my life. I don't even have words to describe it... But well, I had to go back to "real" life. <br>I started working as sales assistant until Sunday, <em>July 29th</em> and after that, holidays started for me. I won't describe how horrible was this job (even though I already worked there last year). But the most important for me was that I was going to meet my Erasmus friends again in <em>1 week</em>, but this time, in Lithuania. <br>We went to Vilnius in <em>August 9th</em>, and we felt like we've never been separated before. We stayed <em>7 days</em> and it was one of the best week of my life! Fortunately, right after that, I went on holidays with my best friend, and then in Portugal with other friends. I had WONDERFUL holidays, but soon ... My alternance will start, and for the <em>first time</em> of my life, I was going to work in a big company : <strong>ORANGE</strong>.</p>

        <h2 class="headline">The beginnig of a new life</h2>
     <h6>Friday, October 20th, 2018</h6>   
<p>I started my alternance on <em>Monday 2nd of September</em>. I met people I will start working with, and everyone was super friendly. I really have the best team I could dream of. I'm working as community manager and I'm in charge of Orange and Sosh Community in the forum website. It's super interesting and community manager was the first job I wanted to try. So I started my alternance the best way I could, and right after my formation, my first week of class started! I'm studying <strong>digital marketing</strong> and I can say one thing: it fits me more than any other pathway. This first week was like an introduction, and I loved it: it was really stimulating. <em>One month past</em> and now, I'm going for my 2nd week at school and I'm learning something new : <strong>coding</strong>. I'm really surprised; I LOVE it. Never had this opportunity before. Now I'm learning basics, and on <em>Monday</em> serious things will start...<br>
